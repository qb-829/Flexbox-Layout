            <h1>Header</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebar-left layout side">
            <p>This sidebar is 300px. It is also Column 1. 
            Its content is different from Column 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebar-right layout side">
            <p>This is the right sidebar. It takes up the space
                remaining from the left side bar. It has the same 
                height as the left side bar. And is just as good, but 
                better. It has a little more content as well. What do
                you think of this color? I really think it suits me.
                Don't you?
